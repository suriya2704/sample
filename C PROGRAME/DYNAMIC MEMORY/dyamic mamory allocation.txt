DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATIO(DMA):  it is the storage ,storage has two type stack memory and dynamic memory. stack memory is unchangeable
 like (int a) which means int has 4 bytes which cannot be changed but dynamic memory can be changed like if we want. if we want high 
space it gives ,if we want lower it will gives based on over needs. this  DMA store in heep memory insteed of stack. which cannot be changed
it is stack memory. it has 4 functions that is malloc(),calloc(),realloc(),free() and also consist <stdlib.h> headee or library.

malloc() : memory allocation(malloc).it allocate total memory let say (int*)malloc(12).which means it has 12 bytes.each int has 4 bytes
which means i can perform 3 loops.because it perform total bytes not single bytes in a loop .it only works in pointers like *ptr=malloc().
